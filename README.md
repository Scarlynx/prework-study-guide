# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- What was your motivation? Students, including myself, have issues on where to start in their studies for software engineering. So, I have created a page that will help us get started.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") This project was to help you get started with Git/GitHub, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- What problem does it solve? Instead of going back and rereading the prework or searching in different places to get what you need, you'll have everything you need to know on a simplified webpage for students.
- What did you learn? I learned how to code using HTML, create styles for a webpage using CSS, and added functions to the code with Javascript. I also learned how to pull, push, call PR, and merge my projects onto GitHub using the terminal (Git functions).

## Usage

- To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git). For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
